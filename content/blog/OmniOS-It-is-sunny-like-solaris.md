## OmniOS: It's Sunny Like Solaris

![OmniOS Logo](https://omnios.org/OmniOSce_logo.svg)

As part of my interest in Unix and Sun Microsystems, I have begun to try out using OmniOS Community Edition in a VM. So far though, all I managed to do was install it in Qemu/KVM VM on my main PC and setup OpenCSW's repositories. 

The first, and admittedly only thing I did with the Install was compile and run the fastfetch package from GitHub. This was slightly more involved than expected though, owing to the OS not being a Linux System. It turned out that I needed to add some specific flags to compile correctly with GCC, this was after a rather involved StackOverflow search however.
