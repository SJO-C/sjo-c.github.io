In Late 2024, I was internally selected to be a member of the University of Lincoln's University Challenge Audition Team, following a quiz/assessment handled by the Students' Union.  This was the 4th and Final Time I did so, having done so each year, since my First Year.  As I was the only member of the year's selection to have previously been selected, I was chosen to be the Team Captain, and as such was responsible for handling the paperwork and communication with the Production Company (Dock10).  Following a series of team get-togethers and discussions with both the team and producers, we [the team] had our audition in Birmingham in the January of 2025.  


Then, around 2 Weeks Later, I [as Team Captain] recieved a phone call, from one of the producers, informing me that the Team had been successful in our Audition and would be filmed for our First Round Match at the end of February.  I immediately informed the rest of the team to the news.


Next, we travlled to Manchester on the 26th Feb to be filmed the following morning for our First Match.  This Match was Broadcast on the 1st September on BBC2 and is viewable in the UK [here.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002j0hj/university-challenge-202526-8-lincoln-v-lancaster)

And was won by us [Lincoln] with **170** Points to Lancaster's **145**.

Thus, putting us through to the 2nd Round which is expected to be broadcast on the Mon 15th Dec 2025.
