I have been 'home-labbing' since 2021 whilst studying.  The systems have been consistently small scale using Proxmox VE on small, low powered Intel N5105 Router Mini-PCs, and more recently on a 2nd Hand HP MicroServer Gen6.  Other components have/do included TP_Link 2.5GbE 5 Port Switch, an off-brand 2.5GbE Managed Switch, GLiNet Travel Router and a 16 Port 1GbE TP_Link Switch.

Currently, I self-host a set of VMs, one of which runs Docker, and one running OpenMediaVault - which serves as a local backup (Apple Time Machine) server for my MacBook.  The underlying Proxmox host (the HP Server) uses a ZFS filesystem and is rsync'd to a remote NAS running TrueNAS Scale.

The remote NAS runs a number of Docker Services including Plex, Jellyfin, Pinry (Self-hosted Pinterest Alternative), CraftyControl (Minecraft), Mealie (A food recipe manager), and PiHole for Ad-Blocking and Local DNS resolution.

The remote NAS also runs an instance of Home Assistant for my Parents to control their heating system owing to the poor quality of the system's native app.
